<p>I am currently studying computer science. I am getting the opportunity to learn how to create web apps with
    Duhlimarta. Planning to graduate from Grand Valley in December 2017.</p>
<p>I love to spend my time running, camping, and going to music shows. Over the summer I was able to go to a few music
    festivals. With some friends, camped in Illinois and through out different campgrounds in Michigan.</p>
